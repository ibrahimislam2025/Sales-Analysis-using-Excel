## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Structuring
- Organized raw data into structured, filterable columns.  
- Ensured accuracy in dates, IDs, and product categories.  

### ➗ Formulas & Calculations
- **Cell Referencing** → applied both **relative** and **absolute referencing** for flexible formulas.  
- **Basic Functions**:  
  - `SUM()` → total sales, commissions  
  - `SUMIF()` / `SUMIFS()` → conditional sales analysis  
  - `AVERAGEIF()` / `AVERAGEIFS()` → average sales based on criteria  
  - **User-Defined Formulas** → custom logic for commissions and reports  
  - **Conditional Formatting** 🎨 → highlighted top values, trends, and outliers  
- **Total Sales** → `Quantity × Price per Unit`  
- **Commission (2023 & 2024)** → applied rate-based formulas.  

### 📊 Pivot Tables, Charts & Slicers
- Created **Pivot Tables** for summarization:  
  - 🧍‍♂️ Sales by **Category & Gender**  
  - 👶👨‍🦳 Sales by **Customer Generation**  
  - 📊 Overall sales contribution by product category  
- Built **Pivot Charts 📈** for data visualization.  
- Added **Slicers 🔘** to enable interactive filtering across reports.
